SHE BUILT NYC!
Is the significant first step in creating a public art collection that more fully represents the diverse history of New York City, beginning with commemorations of visionary and inspiring women.

Through August 1, She Built NYC! invites New York City residents to submit nominations for women or events in womenâ€™s history that should be considered for future public commemorations. We ask that individuals limit their nominations to no more than 3.
