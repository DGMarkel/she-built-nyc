<h1>SHE BUILT NYC!</h1>
<p>
Is the significant first step in creating a public art collection that more fully represents
the diverse history of New York City, beginning with commemorations of visionary and inspiring
women.
</p><p>
She Built NYC! invites New York City residents to submit nominations for women
or events in womenâ€™s history that should be considered for future public commemorations. We ask
that individuals limit their nominations to one.
