Application Description:

sheBuiltNYC invites New Yorkers to join us in our effort to build new public monuments that honor womenâ€™s history
in New York City.   Our advisory panel will announce the subject and site of the monument for the winning nominee in January 2019.

This is an open call for nominations. We invite you to submit one nominee, and vote on all of our nominees,
from the vast array of inspiring women who have contributed to our city.

This is an educational site.  The public is free to explore all of our nominee profiles, to learn about important figures in New York history.  However, only registered users can make nominations, vote on nominations, and comment on them.

This is a social site. Registered users are free to edit and delete their comments and replies.  The comments section is monitored by admins, who can edit and delete user comments and replies, as well as remove abusive users entirely.  If a user is removed from the site, all of their data (nominations, comments, and replies) is preserved for public viewing.

Admins are free to delete proposals that don't fall under the purview of our mission to commission new monuments based on public rankings of our nominations.
